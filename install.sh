# Builds an isolated virtual environment under ~/.local/share/release-check,
# copies the application into it, and links the launcher into ~/.local/bin.
# The copy is deliberate: once installed, this source directory is no longer
# needed to run the tool, and moving or deleting it changes nothing.
#
# Safe to re-run — it upgrades an existing install in place.

#   ./install.sh              install or upgrade
#   ./install.sh --uninstall  remove it completely
