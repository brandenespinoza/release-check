"""Collapsing duplicate Deezer catalogue entries.

Deezer routinely lists the same underlying release several times: territorial
variants, explicit and clean pairs, and reissues each get their own album ID.
Printing all of them would bury the actual news.

Grouping is by base title, version markers, artist and release type, so
genuinely distinct products stay separate: a live album never merges into the
studio album, and a single never merges into the album of the same name.
