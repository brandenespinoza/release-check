"""Release classification: Album / EP / Single / Unknown.

Deezer's ``record_type`` is the primary signal but it is not consistent — the
catalogue contains three-track "albums" and eight-track "singles". So the
declared type is cross-checked against track count and total duration, and the
structural evidence is allowed to override it only when the disagreement is
large. When neither signal is trustworthy the release is reported as Unknown
rather than guessed at.
