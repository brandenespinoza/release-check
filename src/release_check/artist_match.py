"""Resolving local artist names to Deezer artist IDs.

The library has no stable external identifiers, so resolution rests on name
evidence corroborated by catalogue overlap: a candidate that shares album
titles with what is already on disk is almost certainly the right artist,
while a same-named candidate with nothing in common probably is not.

Artist names are never split on ``&``, ``and``, ``feat.``, ``vs.`` or commas.
Those substrings occur inside real names, and splitting them fabricates
artists that do not exist.
