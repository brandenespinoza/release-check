"""`block` and `unblock`: suppressing an artist, or one release.

Two things can be unwanted in the results, and they are identified in different
ways. An artist is a row in your library, so it is named locally. A release is
a Deezer record, so it is named by its Deezer id or URL — the one printed in
the results list, which is the whole point: you see a line you don't want and
paste it back.

Both spellings are accepted for `--artist` regardless, because an artist with
no Deezer counterpart at all is exactly the kind you most want to block, and
it has no id to give.
