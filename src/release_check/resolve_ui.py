"""Interactive resolution of ambiguous artists.

The scan never asks questions; this is where the answers get given. For each
artist the scan could not resolve confidently, the user picks one or more
Deezer artists, blocks the artist, clears what is known, or leaves it alone.

Candidates are shown with a few of their album titles, because "which Ghost is
mine" is answerable from a track listing and almost never from a fan count.
