"""Deciding whether a Deezer release is already in the local library.

Two independent lines of evidence are used:

*title identity* — the normalised base title, with cosmetic edition markers
removed but meaningful version markers preserved; and

*recording coverage* — whether each individual recording on the Deezer release
already exists somewhere in the artist's local catalogue, matched on track
title, version marker and duration.

Coverage is what makes singles behave sensibly: an advance single whose only
track is already on an owned album is not reported, while a single carrying an
exclusive B-side or a different mix is. Where the evidence cannot settle the
question the release is marked ambiguous and shown in a review section rather
than being asserted as missing.
